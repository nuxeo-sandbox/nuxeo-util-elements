# About nuxeo-util-elements

Helpful elements for working with Polymer.

## Elements

[API and Docs](http://nuxeo-sandbox.github.io/nuxeo-util-elements/)

## Dependencies

Install Node.js (I use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/))

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the elements' dependencies:

    bower install


## Demo

If you wish to work on the elements in isolation, we recommend that you use [Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep the elements' bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve -p 3000

Once running, you can view the elements' documentation at `http://localhost:3000/components/nuxeo-util-elements/`.


## Support

**These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.
